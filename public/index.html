			<h1>Important Side and Open Source Projects</h1>
			<p>
				During my studies I was often contacted by colleagues who
				asked for websites. That's when I founded 
				<a href="https://npiece.com">NPIECE</a>,
				a portfolio hosting platform, and started the development of it in 2008.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've discovered <a href="http://cakephp.org">CakePHP</a>
				(a web framework, which was just getting big as part of the hype that followed
				Rails), while looking for a technological basis.
				It still needed some work, to make it useful for the purposes of my startup. To me
				this was also a chance, to contribute to something impactful.
			</p>
			<p>
				After submitting important improvements, I was accepted into the framework project as a Core Developer in 2009 and
				continued in that role until 2010. I'm still very grateful
				for the time and colleagues I've met.
			</p>
			<p>
				After CakePHP came <a href="http://li3.me">li₃</a> (“the
				Jimi Hendrix of frameworks”), founded by the former Lead
				Developer and Product Manager of CakePHP, who I've followed onto
				the new project: first as a Core Developer from 2009 to 2016,
				then starting in mid-2016 as the Lead Developer of the framework.
			</p>
			<p>
				While designing the globalization package of the framework, I've created Gettext PO/MO loaders for PHP. And I was glad to see, that these
				have been imported into Symfony (a popular PHP framework), wehre they
				<a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/ed0b361d6f25963e41cc9d3cd78129b723e78def/src/Symfony/Component/Translation/Loader/PoFileLoader.php">
					are still in use today
				</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				During the foundational years of Atelier Disko (a digital agency) I've built <a href="http://b-series.org">B-Series</a>, 
				an Open Source CMS and eCommerce System, which became the basis of nearly all client projects of the agency. With growing 
				needs in the years that came after, I've built developer, workflow and 
				<a href="https://github.com/atelierdisko/hoi">infrastructure tooling</a>.
			</p>	
			<p>
				<a href="https://rundsk.com">DSK</a> is an Open
				Source workbench to create design systems, that
				I'm co-developing ince 2018. Its principles and our
				journey have been <a href="https://www.christophlabacher.com/notes/building-a-design-system-workbench">greatly described</a> in Christoph's Journal.
