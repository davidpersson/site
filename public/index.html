			With 15+ years experience in software engineering in total, and 6+ years in management I'm adding meaningful contributions within a larger context and help others to exceed their own expectations. 
		</p>

		<p>
			As an engineering leader and passionate open source engineer I enjoy to collaborate with people all around the world. I'm convinced <em>how we create software</em> today can still be improved. I support a bottom-up culture where we work in an atmosphere of mutual respect and where teams resonate well with the organization's wider mission.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm convinced that major challenges can only be solved together and in well-functioning relationships. The people I lead or report to can rely on me in all situations. Open and honest communication is especially important to me.
